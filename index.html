        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my software development ePortfolio. Here you will find key artifacts and enhancements that reflect my growth in areas such as software design, data structures, and database management.This eportfolio reflects on my education at SNHU. </p>

        <h2>Artifact</h2>
       <p> The artifact that I will be using is the Grazioso Salvare application. This application serves to identify dogs for training. The software works with existing data from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. This was created about a month ago. I wanted to focus on this artifact specifically because of the technology used. Python, and MongoDB.</p>

        <h2>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
         <p> The artifact that I will be using is the Grazioso Salvare application. This application serves to identify dogs for training. The software works with existing data from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. This was created about a month ago. I wanted to focus on this artifact specifically because of the technology used. Python, and MongoDB. As well as the algorithms used in this artifact. Python is a language that I am currently learning, as well as MongoDB. I wanted to improve my knowledge and skills for them. The specific components that I believed that I excelled on was data and the algorithms. I improved the artifact by removing repetition. I really wanted to clean my code and make it more modular and simpler to read. So removing all of the nearly identical if.. elif.. else statements and using filters reduce the chance of typos or bugs. Also, while cleaning the callback code.
         <p> I believe that with this enhancement I did achieve the following outcome: Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution.-	Enhancing this artifact has been a great experience so far. I was able to revisit the project, and identify the core objective, and improve the user experience. Since, it was a simple update. I did not necessarily experience any challenges. The only hinderance was going over the codebase again, and making sure I know what each line is doing. Therefore, it was only time-consuming, not challenging.</p>   </p>

        <h2>Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
        <p>This enhancement focuses on the use of efficient data structures and algorithms to optimize application performance.</p>
        <p> The artifact that I will be using is the Grazioso Salvare application. This application serves to identify dogs for training. The software works with existing data from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. This was created about a month ago. -	I improved my project by optimizing the data structure through MongoDB indexing on frequently queried fields and enhancing the filtering algorithm by projecting only necessary fields. This reduces memory load, speeds up queries, and improves scalability, making the dashboard more efficient for large datasets. These show my skills to continue to scale an application overtime without making it full of bugs or being slow. I was able to improve my data structure to make my artifact faster.</p>
        <p>I did meet my course outcome that I had planned for this and this was course outcome: Improving the data structure and algorithm of my artifact.I learned that sometimes even the simplest changes will yield great results. For this enhancement improving the speed of the project is crucial in my opinion. You want to make sure that the app is running efficiently especially as I will be continuing to add to it. </p>

        <h2>Enhancement Three: Databases</h2>
        <p>This enhancement focuses on improving database interactions and implementing best practices for data persistence and retrieval.</p>
        <p>The artifact that I will be using is the Grazioso Salvare application. This application serves to identify dogs for training. The software works with existing data from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. This was created about a month ago.</p>
        <p>This artifact is one that I wanted to include because I want to improve on Python, which is increasingly becoming more popular to use. Python will help me with being able to gain the skills that I need to do well with machine learning. Therefore, this artifact has allowed me to practice. My artifact was improved in the CRUD process. I wanted to include sorting and error handling.-	I learned the importance of error handling. Mainly because it will prevent your application from crashing. I ran into this problem in the class that the artifact was made. My app was crashing when it was running on dash. So now, including error handling has helped make the app run smoother.</p>
